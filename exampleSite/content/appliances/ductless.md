These brands specialize in ductless mini-split systems, which offer efficient heating and cooling solutions without the need for traditional ductwork. 

Ductless systems are known for their flexibility, energy efficiency, and individual room temperature control. These brands likely focus on providing various options within the ductless HVAC technology sector. We offer [Daikin](https://daikincomfort.com/products/heating-cooling/single-zone) [Airtemp]() and [Fujitsu](https://www.fujitsugeneral.com/us/residential/index.html) mini-split ductless systems. 

<h4 style="color:rgb(28,62,211)">Installation and Design</h4>

Ductless mini-split systems consist of an outdoor compressor unit and one or more indoor air-handling units (evaporators). These indoor units are typically mounted on walls or ceilings and are connected to the outdoor unit through refrigerant lines and electrical cables.
The absence of ductwork means that these systems are particularly suited for buildings without existing duct systems, or where installing ducts would be impractical or expensive.
Zoning:

One of the significant advantages of ductless systems is their ability to provide zoning. Each indoor unit can be controlled independently, allowing different rooms or zones to be heated or cooled to different temperatures based on individual preferences.
This zoning capability enhances energy efficiency by avoiding unnecessary heating or cooling of unoccupied spaces.
Energy Efficiency:

Ductless systems are generally more energy-efficient compared to traditional forced-air systems that use ducts. Ducts can lead to significant energy losses due to leaks, poor insulation, and airflow issues.
The absence of ducts eliminates these losses and helps maintain higher energy efficiency.
Flexibility and Ease of Installation:

Ductless mini-split systems are relatively easy to install compared to traditional systems that require extensive ductwork. Installation usually involves creating a small hole in the wall for refrigerant and electrical lines, minimizing the disruption to the building's structure.
Heating Capability:

Ductless mini-splits can also provide heating in addition to cooling. They work by reversing the refrigeration cycle, extracting heat from the outside air and transferring it indoors even during colder months. This makes them an efficient option for both heating and cooling needs.
Aesthetic Appeal:

Ductless indoor units are designed to be sleek and unobtrusive, often resembling wall-mounted art pieces or air vents. This aesthetic appeal can enhance the interior design of a space.
Differences from Traditional Air Conditioning Systems:

Ducts:

Traditional air conditioning systems rely on ducts to distribute conditioned air throughout a building. Ducts can be prone to air leaks, leading to energy loss and reduced efficiency.
Zoning and Temperature Control:

Traditional systems typically provide central temperature control for an entire building. Zoning capabilities are limited, and adjusting temperatures in specific areas may not be as precise.
Installation Complexity:

Traditional systems require the installation of ducts, which can be a complex and time-consuming process. Retrofitting ducts into existing buildings can be particularly challenging.
Energy Efficiency:

Due to the potential for duct leaks and energy losses, traditional systems may be less energy-efficient compared to ductless mini-split systems.
